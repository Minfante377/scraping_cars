# Scraping task

This repository is the solution of the two following tasks:

## Test 1:

> 1. Given the list of brands: [Dodge, Nissan, Lamborghini, Ferrari] Build a script that gets results from the following urls (use 90210 as zipcode):
> - https://www.truecar.com/
> - https://www.autotrader.com/
> 2. Normalize the data and save it into a SQLite file.
> 3. Before adding a result, make sure it's not duplicated.
> 4. Build a small web app or API (Flask, Django, FastAPI, or any similar) that allows the user to search those results and filter/sort them by brand, year, model, and price (or price range for filtering)

## Test 2:
> 1. Using the DuckDuckGo API (https://api.duckduckgo.com/), search for "The Simspons Characters" and build a JSON file containing The Character name, Page URL and Icon URL for each result
> 2. Make sure the name of the Character does not include any extra text, for instance if a Character name is "Radioactive Man (The Simpsons character)", we only want the "Radioactive Man" section
